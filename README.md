## Introduction

The Clean Axum Demo showcases how to create a well-structured API server in Rust using Axum. Clean architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, making your code easier to manage and test. This project serves as a starting point for developers looking to build robust and maintainable applications.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Organized into distinct layers for better maintainability.
- **Easy to Extend**: Add new features without affecting existing functionality.
- **Testable**: Each component can be tested independently.
- **Performance**: Leverages Rust's speed and safety.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Clean Axum Demo, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Install Rust. You can follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- Ensure you have Cargo, Rust's package manager, installed.

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Unico88/clean_axum_demo.git
cd clean_axum_demo
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
cargo build
```

### Run the Server

To start the API server, execute:

```bash
cargo run
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **src/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **api/**: Handles API routes and request handling.
  - **domain/**: Contains business logic and domain models.
  - **infrastructure/**: Manages external dependencies like databases and services.
  - **presentation/**: Manages the user interface and API responses.
- **tests/**: Contains integration tests to ensure the application works as expected.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it using tools like Postman or cURL. Here are some example endpoints:

### Get All Items

```http
GET /items
```

### Create a New Item

```http
POST /items
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "New Item",
  "description": "Description of the new item"
}
```

### Get Item by ID

```http
GET /items/{id}
```

### Update an Item

```http
PUT /items/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Updated Item",
  "description": "Updated description"
}
```

### Delete an Item

```http
DELETE /items/{id}
```
